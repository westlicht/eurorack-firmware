## "Drums" alternative firmware

This firmware mod replaces the original drum synthesis modes with sample playback. Due to size restrictions, in addition to the drum synthesis modes, all the advanced modes are removed as well, leaving only the ENV, LFO, TAP and DRUM modes. By default, the 2 drum samples are based on the EEPROMs of 909 ride and hats. In drum mode, the following controls are available:

#### Twin & Expert Mode

- Ch. 1/2 Pitch
- Ch. 1/2 Envelope
- Ch. 1/2 white noise mix amount
- Unassigned

#### Split Mode

- Ch. 1 Pitch
- Ch. 1 Envelope
- Ch. 2 Pitch
- Ch. 2 Envelope
